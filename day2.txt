THE  DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DOCUMENT AND WINDOW OBJECTS



In javascript , both document and window are essential objects that play crucial roles in web development. Here’s a straight forward explanation of difference between document and window object

The window object

Scope : Represents the entire browser window or frame that  displays the web page
Purpose : Manages the browser context and environment.
Key functions :
       * Global object  : Holds global variables and functions. For example, if you declare var X = 5;, it is accessible as window.x.
      * Browser control : Provides methods to control the browser, such as window.alert(), window.open(), and window.close().
      * Event Handling : Manages events like resizing (window.onresize) and scrolling (window.onscroll)


The document object

Scope :  Represents the HTML document currently loaded in the browser.
Purpose : Provides access to and manipulation of the content within the webpage
Key functions : 
       * DOM Manipulation : Allows you to interact with the document object model (DOM) . For example, document.getElementById(‘id’) retrieves an element by its ID.
       * Content Access :  Lets you read and modify the content of the web page, such as document.title to get or set the page title.
                * Element Creation : Methods  like document.createElement() allow you 
          to create  new HTML elements dynamically.
